        summary={`The following automation uses both the ESPresence and Ring Motion sensor
              to detect if someone is in a room. At first I built this automation to only use Motion
              Sensor but it did not work the way I wanted since Motion Sensors have difficulty
              picking up small motion. As a result my wife would get upset because the room would go
              dark while she is reading. ðŸ˜… The automation you see below is the improved version that
              uses ESPresence to determine if a person is in currently in a room by tracking specific bluetooth
              enabled devices such as our phones.`}

                While the automation is allowed to run, it check the stored
                property if the motion triggered on. If it did, it checks the{" "}
                <b>Motion Gate</b> one more time and then sets the lights to
                100%. At the same time (in parallel) it checks to see if the
                lights are on. If the lights are on, the automation starts the
                process to "turn off the lights".

                  is true then it will start two parallel processes. Both
                  process are debounced nodes that will execute after 10 and 20
                  mins of <em>NO ACTIVITY</em>. This mean that once the lights
                  turn on or the room registers that there is no motion It will
                  start a 10 minute time and a 20 minute timer. If there is no
                  activity, for 10 minutes the first timer will move on and
                  check to see if ESPresence detects noone in the room. If this
                  true it will check the <b>Motion Gate</b>
                  again and then set the lights to 40% brightness. After 10 more
                  minutes of inactivity if no motion was detected the last
                  debounce node will move forward and verify with ESPresences
                  that there is noone in the room at which point the lights will
                  turn off.
